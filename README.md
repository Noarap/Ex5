I could make each row of description added to be editable, as the user clicks on the todo item, it turns into a text box and the user can change their task description.
I think it's very intuitive for the user, and it's not hard to implement. I simply add a view that get the input from the user and changes the description in the TodoItem class, and in the list pf items.
